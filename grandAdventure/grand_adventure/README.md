# grand_adventure

A simple RPG adventure made by Matthías Enok Þórarinsson. 


Grand Adventure is a mixture between a choose your own adventure and a old school RPG and takes inspiration from dungeon crawlers and rogue. 
The main goal is to reach day 10 and fight a dragon but along the way you come across other enemies and random events. 
The events ofter give you a chance to increase your power or buy your way past some hazards but be careful not to spend all of your gold as 
doing so will trigger a starvation event which might kill you. 
All the events between 1 and 10 are random. The fates will decide if your journey is successful or not.

This is my both my first solo flutter project and first game. 
It has been a fantastic learning experience both in flutter and how not organize and  write code. 
The lessons i learned here will definitely help me in the future both in writing better code and 
flow management so hopefully my next project wont be as much of a mess. 


Thank you for taking your time in checking this out.
